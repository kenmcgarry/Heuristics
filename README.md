#1 Heuristics

Humans find the detection of unusual or interesting patterns rather easy, however it is notoriously difficult to embed this generic characteristic within a computer as each application is often very different. For example, advances in image processing and pattern detection across diverse areas such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis require highly specific training data, often using many tens of thousands of exemplars. The approach we take in this work is to develop cognitive based heuristics to mimic to a certain extent the decision making taken by humans. We implement several of the well known heuristics such as Take-The-Best (TTB) and Elimination-By-Aspect (EBA) comparing their effectiveness in detecting interesting patterns. We integrate the heuristics with interestingness measures derived from Bayesian networks trained on several datasets. The Bayesian networks enable a probabilistic interpretation of variable relationships which is used by the interestingness measures to provide further numerical indications to determine the appropriateness of any candidate pattern in terms of how novel and surprising it is. The objective measures are combined with subjective knowledge (where available) to provide a fuller account of overall pattern interestingness. The heuristics are used as a post-processor to select those patterns that should be further scrutinized by the data analyst.
